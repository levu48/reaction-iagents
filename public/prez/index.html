					## What is iAgents.io?
					
					**iAgents.io** is a software technology company, building the foundation of *Internet Agents* technology that can be used to create autonomous software programs that can *travel* the Internet, *communicate* with other agents, and do thing on the behalf of their owners. 
					</script>
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					<script type="text/template">
					##iAgents.io

					With the richness of information and services that the Internet can offer, this technology can improve *productivity*, and create more *opportunity* for everybody.

					This is something almost entirely *new* and will *make* the Internet significantly better.
					</script>
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					<script type="text/template">
					##The Current Problems

					Internet users spend too much time to get things done. For example, to search the Internet, a user types in keywords then have to manually search through thousands of entries.
					</script>
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					<script type="text/template">
					Typically, server collects user personal data and try to narrow the search space. 

					First, this violates user privacy. 

					Second, one size does not fit all, one generalized search algorithm does not fit for all users.
					</script>
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					<script type="text/template">
					##Perspectives

					It would be better to let software agents conduct business similar to the way human normally would:

					- client inquires server for the list of services or products
					- server provides set of information
					- client analyzes the data, then either makes further inquiries or makes a decision and concludes the transaction.

					The challenge here is that both clients and server have to be able to communicate and understand each others. 

					Does that mean we are dealing with natural language processing? Isnt it too hard a problem for today technology?
					</script>
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					<script type="text/template">
					##Perspectives

					It is true. We dont have natural language processing working today.

					But a lot of problems on the Internet does not require natural language processing. After all, we "communicate" with search engines by typing in keywords, not natural language sentences!

					It is possible to create useful software agents that can communicate based on keywords or domain-specific terminologies and conventions.
					</script>
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					<script type="text/template">
					##Perspectives

					Server knows best what it provides. And client knows what it wants.

					So, server should stick to providing information, and let client makes decisions based on its own preferences.
					</script>
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					<script type="text/template">
					##Perspectives

					However, the current practice is the other way around, the server collects user preferences in such forms as cookies and try to predict what the user wants and present products or services accordingly. 

					Prediction is hard, because server does not know what clients want.
					</script>
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					<script type="text/template">
					##Ecommerce scenarios

					1. Client asks for categories of products
					2. Server provides main categories of its services (typically what already presented as head navigation items.)
					3. Client requests list of products of particular categories or of particular keywords
					4. Server provides list of products the best it can make sense from the keywords
					5. Client filters out further through its own preferences, and narrow down a single or a small list of products for purchase
					</script>
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					<script type="text/template">
					##Benefits: Distributed Computing

					- Clients does work on its own machine, making good form of distributed computing, the server is not overloaded with too much processing.
					- Too many client devices, such as laptops, smartphones, are idle, while servers are often overloaded. Not fair! in term of distributed computing, that is.
					</script>
				</section>


				<section data-markdown>
					<script type="text/template">
					##Challenges

					OK, it sounds good, but in what form can individual user express the logic of programming. Isnt it supposed to be hard for normal users?

					</script>
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					<script type="text/template">
					##Solutions

					In the realm of Artificial Intelligence, there has been what so called Expert Systems, which are used for this purpose, to let non-programmers to express domain knowledge.

					This technology can be used in this scenario, ranging from using simple keywords, to simple rules, or even complex sets of rules.

				<section data-markdown>
					<script type="text/template">
					##Communication Sequence

					- Client send something like 'request categories' to server. Most of server would understand this to mean the sitemap or main categories of products. Overtime we predict, some popular conventions will emerge, and will be used by majority of both clients and servers.
					- Server provides a set of products in the form of hierarchial JSON tree structures.

					</script>
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					<script type="text/template">
					- Client can search the tree, traverse the tree, get basic data like name, price, and description. Client can further ask server for more detailed information about a particular product, for example, 'how many times this car has been involved in accidences?'
					- Client filters the products based on its previously set preferences or customized rules.

					</script>
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					<script type="text/template">
					- If Client found what is wants, it can notify its owner, or proceed with transactions.
					- If Client does not find any satisfactory match, it might request server for a different set of products based on categories, or tag keywords. And the cycle repeats. 

					</script>
				</section>

					<script type="text/template">
					##The Demo: Art Store Ecommerce Application

					- Store sells art works
					- Client requests categories
					- Server returns "watercolor, acrylic, oil, sculpture"
					- Client requests products for "oil paintings"
					- Client filters according to types of paintings: figurative, portrait, or landscape
					- Client selects products with lowest prices
					</script>
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					<script type="text/template">
					##The Demo
					
					It seems like this can be done by today ecommerce system.

					True, but the way it was done is different.

					In the old way, the server does everything
						
					- The criteria has to be simple in order to apply for all clients
					</script>
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					<script type="text/template">

					In the new way, the Client participates in data processing

					- uses its own preferences
					- computes on the client side
					- using multiple steps to further refine the result set
					- different client can have its own rules
					- the sophistication pf the search comes from unique preferences specified by diffferent clients. For example, "I want products that are old, cheap, well-maintained, and the owner of the painting comes from a middle-class family in Southern California"
					- Search in multiple steps using inference rules is different from single-step search using database queries on the server-side. 
					</script>
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					<script type="text/template">
					##Server Rules
					
					IF request.categories 
					THEN return watercolor, acrylic, oil and sculpture

					IF request.products.category <name> 
					THEN return products of category <name>

					IF request.products.tag <name>
					THEN return products of tag <name>

					IF request.product.property <name>
					THEN return product property if exists.
					</script>
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					<script type="text/template">
					##Client Rules
					
					IF start
					THEN send request.categories to server

					IF categories include watercolor
					THEN send request.products.category watercolor

					IF product type is landscape or figurative
					THEN put product into the working set

					IF the working set is done
					THEN select the lowest 5 products from working set.
					</script>

					##Future
					
					- Agent Computation
					- Applications
					- Communication standards
					- Library of Agents developed
					- Intelligient emerges from the interaction of large number of agents

					</script>
				</section>


				<section data-markdown>
					<script type="text/template">
					##Conclusions
					
					- Proof of concepts
					- Demonstration of technology
					- Much work to do:

						- Technology foundation
						- Communication protocols
						- Taxonomy and ontology dictionaries
						- Applications
